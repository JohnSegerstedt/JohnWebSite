<h3 style = "margin:0; padding:0;">Master's Thesis at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering:</h3>
<i><b>Generating Character Animation for the Apex Game Engine using Neural Networks</b><br>
- Implementing immersive character animation in an industry-proven game engine by applying machine learning techniques</i><br>
<br>
This thesis was the result of a collaboration with Avalanche Studios Group in Stockholm, Sweden. The full thesis is available <a href="uploads/DATX05-MastersThesis.pdf">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
<i>Abstract:</i><br>
The art of machine learning, here using neural networks to map pairs of inputs to
outputs, has been greatly expanded upon recently. It has been shown to be able to
produce generalizable solutions within multiple different fields of research and has
been deployed in real-world commercial products. One of these research areas in
which regular scientific achievements are made is game development, and specifically character animation. However, compared to other fields, even though there
has been much work on applying machine learning techniques to character animation, few efforts have been made to applying them in real-world game engines. This
thesis project aimed to research the applicability of one such piece of previous work,
within the proprietary Apex game engine. The final results included an in-engine
solution, producing character animation purely from a predicative phase-functioned
neural network. Additionally, several different network configurations were evaluated to compare the impact of using, for example, a deeper network or a network
that had trained for a longer period of time, in an attempt to investigate potential
improvements to the original model. These alterations were shown to have negligible
positive impacts on the final results. Also, an additional network configuration was
used to investigate the applicability of this approach on an industry-used skeleton,
producing promising but imperfect results.

<!-- ------------------ LaggIT-------------------- -->
<h3 style = "margin:0; padding:0;">LaggIT - SCC20 Manager</h3>
During the end of the study year 2019/2020, I was elected onto the board of the E-sports society LaggIT at the Student Division of Software Engineering (IT).
There, I am lead responsible for the E-sports tournament StarCraft II Chalmers Championship 2020 (SCC20).
This includes: finding sponsors, creating and distributing advertisement, application management, match scheduling, live-streaming, providing game commentary, art asset design, etc.
The tournament will be held in November of 2020.

<!-- ------------------ Program Management Council-------------------- -->
<h3 style = "margin:0; padding:0;">Member of the CTH IT+++ Program Management Council</h3>
During the beginning of 2020, I was elected membership onto the council by the Progam Manager for Software Engineering.
The council includes the Program Manager for the Software Engineering Bachelor's and Program Managers of the three IT Master's Program; Software Engineering, Interaction Design, and Data Science and AI.
Also on the council are proffessors, lectors, and industry representatives.
This responsibility includes regularly meeting with the Program Management Council, being the student representative of my master's program.
Additionally, I am one of two tasked to be note adjuster - responsible for making sure that the official notes of the meeting are correct and complete.

<!-- ------------------ MRCIT-------------------- -->
<h3 style = "margin:0; padding:0;">MRCIT - Event Organizer</h3>
During the end of 2019, I was elected onto the committe MRCIT <i>(The Masters Reception Commitee)</i>, who is responsible for 
organizing the reception activities for students starting at the Software Engineering and Interaction Design Master's programs.
The main goal of these activities is to familiarize students with the university and each other, similar to a larger team building project.
For some students, this is their first time studying at Chalmers, to others their first time living in Gothenburg, and to some it's their first time in Sweden.

<i><b>Clustering and Classification of Time Series in Real-Time Strategy Games</b><br>
- A machine learning approach for mapping StarCraft II games to clusters of game state time series while limited by fog of war</i><br>
<br>
This thesis was a result of the combined efforts of: me, Olof Enström, Fredrik Hagström, Fredrik Vidberg, Arvid Wartenberg, and David Weber Fors.<br>
It was produced during spring 2019 and scored a final grade of 97/100. The full thesis is available <a href="uploads/DATX02_19_81-BachelorsThesis.pdf">here</a>.

<br>
<i>Abstract:</i><br>
Real-time strategy (RTS) games feature vast action spaces and incomplete information,
thus requiring lengthy training times for AI-agents to master them at the level of a
human expert. Based on the inherent complexity and the strategical interplay between
the players of an RTS game, it is hypothesized that data sets of played games exhibit
clustering properties as a result of the actions made by the players. These clusters
could potentially be used to optimize the training process of AI-agents, and gain
unbiased insight into the gameplay dynamics. In this thesis, a method is presented to
discern such clusters and classify an ongoing game according to which of these clusters
it most closely resembles, limited to the perspective of a single player. Six distinct
clusters have been found in StarCraft II using hierarchical clustering over time, all
of which depend on different combinations of game pieces and the timing of their
acquisitions in the game. An ongoing game can be classified, using neural networks
and random forests, as a member of some cluster with accuracies ranging from 83%
to 96% depending on the amount of information provided.
<br>
<br>
<i>TL;DR</i><br>
We were able to classify ongoing games of StarCraft II, even when limited to the view of a single player, to meaningful clusters 
of game states created by analyzing tens of thousands of high-level games. 
Our results can be used for metagame/strategy analysis, win-prediction, etc, all in real-time.

<!-- ------------------ Class Representative-------------------- -->
<h3 style = "margin:0; padding:0;">Class Representative, (Study Committee)</h3>
Since 2018, I have been a Class Representative.
This involves regularly meeting with the Study Committe at the IT programs; snIT <i>(studienämnden på IT)</i>, who is responsible for 
managing the quality of education in collaboration with the university and the student union.
During these meetings, I represent students in my year of my program.
