		<br><h4>Plants versus Zombies - AR</h4>
		As part of the course <i> DIT466 Technology-driven experimental game design</i>, a three week task was to produce an AR game.
		This resulted in us producing an AR proof-of-concept clone of the game Plants versus Zombies. 
		We scored max grades for the project 5p/5p, and I for the course at large; 65p/65p.
		<br>
		<br>
		This project was done together with: Petra B., & David Campos Rodríguez.

		<br><h4>The Leak</h4>
		As part of the course <i> DIT466 Technology-driven experimental game design</i>, a two week task was 
		produce a small proof-of-concept game using some kind of realtime physics simulation in Unity.
		This resulted in us producing a simple 2D platformer, where the player must carry a bowl of simulated
		liquid across the level. We scored max grades for the project 50p/50p, and I for the course at large; 65p/65p.
		<br>
		<br>
		David Campos Rodríguez was responsible for the liquid simulation and I was responsible for everything else.

		<br><h4>Heart Raiser</h4>
		As part of the course <i> CIU265 - Interaction design project</i>, a six week task was to produce a 
		science center exhibit aimed at children on the theme of quantified self.
		This resulted in us producing the two-player racing game Heart Raiser, where the 
		speed of one's car is correlated to one's heart rate. This project recieved the highest mark: 5/5.
		<br>
		<br>
		This project was done together with: Petra B., David Campos Rodríguez, Ameya Kanojia, &
		Sabrina Samuelsson.

		<br><h4>Space Colonies, The Digital Game</h4>
		A solo programming project where I tried to create a digital version of the board game with the same name, 
		see <a href="john.php?page=other">Other Projects/Interests</a>. 
		The game was written in Unity/C# for the Android platform.
		The game is playable by up to 8 players online.

		<br><h4>Machine Learning in Unity</h4>
		During the first few weeks of the summer of 2020, I explored using the Unity MLAgents library to potentially implement an AI that could play 3Buttons through reinforcement learning.
		The result of an Agent that had a 50% sucess rate of finishing the first level of the game. The project went slow and was scrapped in favour of other endeavours.

		<br><h4>Missile Command clone</h4>
		During the course <i> DAT572 - Game Engine Architecture </i> in 2020, each student was tasked to create an SDL/C++ clone of an old arcade game.
		The focus of the course was the architectural structure of the code base. I scored max grades for the project and for the course at large; 95p/95p.

		<br><h4>John Web Site</h4>
		This web site you are on right now was a project made during mid-February 2020. 
		I came up with the idea after a representative from a company I would be delighted to work at told me 
		that they would want to know more about their applicants than the formal details of their resumes.
		The goal of this site is to provide a continuously updated and detailed presentation of both myself 
		and any project I have worked on.

		<br><h4>3Buttons</h4>
		3Buttons is a short platformer game written by me in Unity C#.
		V1.0 was developed during the summer of 2018.
		This version was later ported to Android and published by the American publishing company Game Mechanic Studios for the Chinese market through Waysun.
		A V2.0 of the game was developed during the summer of 2019 and can be played for free on Steam.
		The game features three campaigns, each with five levels. Whenever a player finishes a campaign, their run is saved to the public
		highscores database.

		<br><h4>Particle System &amp Collision Detection Demo</h4>
		During the course <i> DAT205 - Advanced Computer Graphics </i> in 2019, each student was supposed to implement self chosen graphics related features into a small demo.
		This demo was written in C++ and OpenGL/GLSL. The particle system was able to both feature simple pixel particles and blending of textures to simulate jet engine exhaustion.
		Also, a uniform grid spatial data structure was implemented to speed up collision detection. The implementation was limited to 2D space but could handle any sized objects.

		<br><h4>Java Game Engine</h4>
		During the summer of 2017, I implemented a very small and feature incomplete OpenGL game engine following an online tutorial. 
		This as to give me some basic understanding of common computer graphics principles before being able to take a dedicated university
		course on the subject.

		<br><h4>Student Living GBG</h4>
		This was a joint project between me, Peter Gärdenäs, Jonathan Gildevall, and Erik Magnusson 
		during the course <i>TDA367 - Object-oriented programming project</i> in 2017. We developed an 
		Android app, able to combine all posted student accommodations from both <i>SGS Studentbostäder</i> 
		and <i>Chalmers Studentbostäder</i>. The app had features such as being able to favorite certain search critera
		and to notify the user when a housing was posted that matched that criteria.

		<br><h4>Phone Score Card</h4>
		I took two programming courses during High School, 
		of which the final project during the latter was made on request by the company <i>Vildshärads Fotbollsgolfbana</i> who runs a 
		football golf course. The project was to develop a web based score card for phones.
		The score card was able to calculate pars and users could save their run in a .pdf.
