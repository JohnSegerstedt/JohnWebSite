		<br><h4>3Buttons</h4>
		3Buttons is a short platformer game written by me in Unity C#.
		V1.0 was developed during the summer of 2018.
		This version was later ported to Android and published by the American publishing company Game Mechanic Studios for the Chinese market.
		A V2.0 of the game was developed during the summer of 2019 and can be played for free on Steam.

		<br><h4>Student Living GBG</h4>
		This was a join project between me, Peter Gärdenäs, Jonathan Gildevall, and Erik Magnusson 
		during the course <i>TDA367 - Object-oriented programming project</i>. We developed an 
		Android app, able to combine all posted student accommodations from both <i>SGS Studentbostäder</i> 
		and <i>Chalmers Studentbostäder</i>. The app had features such as being able to favorite certain search critera
		and to notify the user when a housing was posted that matched the given criteria.

		<br><h4>Java Game Engine</h4>
		During the summer of 2017, I implemented a very small and feature incomplete OpenGL game engine following an online tutorial. 
		This as to give me some basic understanding of common computer graphics principles before being able to take a dedicated university
		course on the subject.
