		<br><h4>John Web Site</h4>
		This web site you are on right now was a project made during mid-February 2020. 
		I came up with the idea after a representative from a company I would be delighted to work at told me 
		that they would want to know more about their applicants than the formal details of their resumes.
		The goal of this site is to provide a constantly updating and detailed presentation of both myself 
		and any project I have worked on.

		<br><h4>3Buttons</h4>
		3Buttons is a short platformer game written by me in Unity C#.
		V1.0 was developed during the summer of 2018.
		This version was later ported to Android and published by the American publishing company Game Mechanic Studios for the Chinese market.
		A V2.0 of the game was developed during the summer of 2019 and can be played for free on Steam.
		The game features three campaigns, each with five levels. Whenever a player finishes a campaign, their run is saved to the public
		database. As of 2020-02-13, almost a hundred individual runs have been registered.

		<br><h4>Particle System &amp Collision Detection</h4>
		During the course <i> DAT205 - Advanced Computer Graphics </i> in 2019, each student were supposed to implement self chosen graphics related features into a small demo.
		This demo was written in C++ and OpenGL/GLSL. The particle system featured both  Both for simple pixel particles and for blending textures together to simulate jet engine exhaustion.
		Also, a uniform grid spatial data structure was implemented to speed up collision detection. The implementation was limited to 2D space but could handle any sized objects.

		<br><h4>Java Game Engine</h4>
		During the summer of 2017, I implemented a very small and feature incomplete OpenGL game engine following an online tutorial. 
		This as to give me some basic understanding of common computer graphics principles before being able to take a dedicated university
		course on the subject.

		<br><h4>Student Living GBG</h4>
		This was a join project between me, Peter Gärdenäs, Jonathan Gildevall, and Erik Magnusson 
		during the course <i>TDA367 - Object-oriented programming project</i> in 2017. We developed an 
		Android app, able to combine all posted student accommodations from both <i>SGS Studentbostäder</i> 
		and <i>Chalmers Studentbostäder</i>. The app had features such as being able to favorite certain search critera
		and to notify the user when a housing was posted that matched the given criteria.

		<br><h4>Phone Score Card</h4>
		I took two programming courses during High School, 
		of which the final project during the latter was made on request by the company <i>Vildshärads Fotbollsgolfbana</i> who runs a 
		football golf course. The project was to develop a web based score card for phones.
		The score card was able to calculate pars and users could save their run in a .pdf.
