<h1>Welcome to my Digital Portfolio</h1>

<div style = "width:1000px; height:auto; position:absolute; text-align:left;">
My name is John Segerstedt and I'm currently working as a software developer at the MIB department at Ericsson, Gothenburg.

I have a 5 year Master & Bachelor of Science degree in Interaction Design & Software Engineering.
My two largest passions are game development/design and machine learning. As such, I have been trying to take as many 
courses on those subjects as possible. Additionally, as a result of my dedication to game development, 
I was able to design and produce my own game which I then managed to get sold and published; 3Buttons.
