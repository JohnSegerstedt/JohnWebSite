		<br><h4>John Web Site</h4>
		This web site you are on right now was a project made during mid-February 2020. 
		I came up with the idea behind it after a representative from a company I would be delighted to work at told me that they would want to know more about their applicants than the formal details of their resume.
		The goal of this site is to provide a constantly updating and detailed presentation of both myself and any project I have worked on.
